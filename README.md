# RuruExperiment

Tiny experiment with comparing [ruru](https://github.com/d-unseductable/ruru) and
[FFI](https://github.com/ffi/ffi) to implement Yehuda Katz' `String#blank?` (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqrwPVtSHZI)

Uses the benchmarks from https://github.com/SamSaffron/fast_blank/blob/master/benchmark, because burden of proof.
